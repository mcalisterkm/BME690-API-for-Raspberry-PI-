## Raspberry Pi version of the BME690 API

This is a minimal port of the Bosch Sensortec BME690 air quality sensor for the Raspberry PI removing the COINS dependency and replacing with standard Raspbian/Linux functions. The original Bosch Sensortec BME690 API is available from the Bosch Sensortec GitHub. 

Note: This API is not backward compatible with BME688/680.
